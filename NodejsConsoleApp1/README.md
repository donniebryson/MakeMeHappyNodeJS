# MakeMeHappy JavaScript
It seeks to fulfill the same user story as the Machine Learning for Kids worksheet 'Make me happy' which is written in Scratch.

It assumes that a class has already completed the project in Scratch on the website: https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/worksheets 

If the Scratch version of the worksheet is complete, then the student has a workspace_id, username, and password for Watson. The student must have their model created and tested.These are needed for this script to work.

The file, example_config_file.txt, must be edited to include your actual workspace_id, username, and password and then renamed config.json in the same direcory as makeMeHappy.js.

Each student will need to execute 'npm install watson_developer_cloud' for the proper Watson library.

The code was testing with Node 8.11.3
